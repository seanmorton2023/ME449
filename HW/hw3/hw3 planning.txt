To-Do: ME449 Asst 3

CoppeliaSim time scaling:

problem1
 - 4.5 when video running


problem3
- 2.3 when no video is running
- 7.0 when video recorder is running

- try using regular EulerStep rather than mod. Euler Step to
	see if stability is better




To-Do: For Submission

Formatting

DONE:

- organize files: 
	- make "csv" directory and "vid" directory"
	- remove old filenames
	- make "code" directory when done
- put background and helper functions into introduction
- put "Part 1", ... markers for each problem


TO-DO:

- remove comments and unused code
- add docstrings for functions where needed
- put text description under each problem as needed
- explanation
	- can be short - my last Jupyter notebook didn't need it

Part 1

DONE:
- video for dt where energy seems conserved
- video for dt where system seems to gain energy
- csv file for conserved energy
- csv file for increasing 
- will need to redo sims for problem 1 b/c my springPosn was [0, 1, 2], not [0,0,2]
- note time multipliers used for my own convenience
- note dt for each case


TO-DO:

Part 2

DONE:
- video for positive damping
- video for negative damping
- csv file for positive damping
- csv file for negative damping
- record values of damping, stiffness, gravity used
- writeup: Do you see any strange behavior in the simulation if you choose the damping constant to
	be a large positive value? Can you explain it? 
TO-DO:
How would this behavior be affected if you chose
	shorter simulation timesteps?

Part 3

DONE:
- video for zero gravity, no damping
- video for zero gravity, positive damping
- csv file for zero gravity, no damping
- csv file for zero gravity, positive damping
- record values of damping, stiffness, gravity used
Questions:
- Does the motion make sense to you? 
- Should total energy be conserved? 
- Does the total energy appear to be conserved? 
- Do you see any strange behavior if you choose the spring constant to be large?


Now add a positive damping to the simulation that makes the arm nearly come to rest by the
end of the video. For both videos, record the stiffness and damping you used.
 -> could put in video files, or put in notebook somewhere (in notebook would be more 
	modular/easy to edit

Project Ideation

	Relevant parts of the course text: forward dynamics, 
	inverse dynamics, Newton-Euler recursive dynamics. 
	Look for the formulas that use the M config of each
		joint rel. to. each other
		
	- mr.ForwardDynamics
	- mr.EulerStep
		
	This problem is an: inverse dynamics problem, b/c we 
		know the forces applied at the end effector and
		are trying to find the joint velocities and accelerations
		to get there

________

Steps for doing spring forcing:
- Find current config of end effector
	- find current theta_list
	- apply product of exponentials in space frame, because
		S list given. T = exp([S1]theta1])* ... * M
	- only really need position p so extract that
- Define transformation to get from EE to 
	spring posn, and apply spring force
	Alt 1:
		- I don't like this as much because transformation
			matrices include rotation - we don't want to 
			induce rotation on the E.E.
	- let Tsb be end effector posn, Tsp be spring posn
	- impose that rotation matrix within the spring Tsb
		must be same as the current R of the end effector
	- Tbp = Tbs * Tsp
	- Calculate diff. in p
	- Forces proportional to displacement. Make a wrench
		with Fs = [0, 0, 0, k*deltax, k*deltay, k*deltaz]
		
	Alt 2:
	 - extract position p from Tsb and compare to p from springPosn
	 - difference in p will give a new p-vector
	 - 	Forces proportional to displacement. Make a wrench
		with Fs = [0, 0, 0, k*deltax, k*deltay, k*deltaz]

Part 1: Robot in Gravity
- gravity acting on all the joints of the robot
- simulate wrenches due to:
	- applied forces (0)
	- gravity vector (-g)
	
- Lots of it is already written in the code: solves the
	forward dynamics problem for us, then gives us 
	thetad and thetadd at next timestep
- No "required joint forces" for this part of the HW -
	it's just gravity

-Outline:
	- Call ForwardDynamics() with starting values of thetad,
		thetadd, theta
	- use numerical integration to find theta, thetad at next timestep
		- I don't really like first-order Euler integration. take
			the EulerStep code and modify to include accel term
			in calculating theta
	- store value of theta at next timestep in an array; theta and
		thetad in just a regular variable for next calculation
	- Write the theta_array to a CSV file
	- import the CSV file into CoppeliaSim
	- adjust time multiplier so it takes 5s real time to play file.
		record results for time multiplier.

Part 2: Damping
- Same general loop structure as last time. Copy and paste it in the
	Py file, then fill in with modifications
- Store not just theta and thetad, but also thetadd, for use in
	next iter. of loop
		- for validation: could make sure to store arrays of 
			thetadd and damping force, and make sure force = B * w
- Calculate damping torques and use in tau_list 

Part 3: Spring Force
- same general structure as before, but:
- do not apply damping at first
- calculate spring force according to method above
- use it as the end effector wrench 

- currently p is defined in the space frame; define displacement
	of spring in the body frame instead?
	
- spring forces: although forces are only linear
- check on magnitude of spring displacement in end effector
	frame - distance doesn't seem to be the same - resolved

- try reversing the direction of force - so that robot moves toward the point of interest
	- figure out why later. other people had this too
	
	
results:
- 1.5 through 3 are good
 - 5 is starting to get a little unstable - might be gaining energy
- 8 gives 2 periodic oscillations, and it passes pretty close to the target point. I like it
#used time multiplier of about 3, but at this scale, motions don't appear realistic


#####

Define functions to use here
- Write to csv(): use code from HW2
- ModEulerStep(): modifies EulerStep to 
	have second order term
- Puppet(): 
	- takes in
		- damping stiffness restLength
		- g, Mlist, Glist, Slist (g may be 0 in one sim)
		- thetalist0, dthetalist0
	- calculates
		- end effector wrench Ftip
		- applied joint torques taulist
	- calls 
		- mr.ForwardDynamics(thetalist,dthetalist,taulist,
			g,Ftip,Mlist,Glist,Slist)
		- ModEulerStep(thetalist,dthetalist,ddthetalist,dt)
		- SpringForce()
		- DampingForce()
	- returns: a N x n matrix of joint values, N = # of timesteps,
		n = number of joints

- SpringForce()
	- Calculates the "spring force" acting on the end effector
		of the robot, using position of end of spring, position
		of end effector, and spring parameters.
	- takes in:
		-Slist: list of screw axes in space frame 
		-thetalist: list of current joint angles 
		-Mlist: home configurations of each joint rel. to.
			each other
		-stiffness: scalar with spring constant
		-springPos: 3-vector position 
		-restLength: scalar with resting length of spring
	- calls:
		- T = FKinBody(M_endeff, Blist, thetalist)
		- [R,p] = TranstoRp(FKinBody)
		- x_diff = np.linalg.norm(deltap) - restLength
	- returns:
        Ftip, a 6x1 end-effector wrench caused by the spring force
		
- DampingForce():
	- Make a torque at each joint, equal to B * w
	- takes in:
		- damping constant B
		- thetad_list: an nd-array, where n = # of joints of robot
	- returns:
		- an nd-array of joint torques, where n = # of joints
	- let the required forces for robot to apply be tau_list
		= ****-***** (neg important) * omega_list
	- note to me: other than the forces the robot is applying, robot will be in
		free fall
