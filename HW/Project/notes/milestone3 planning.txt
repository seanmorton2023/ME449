To-Do:

- use pseudoinverse to calculate [u thetadot] = Jt(theta) V(t)
	----> assume no feedback control for now
- calculate new chassis configuration using odometry
	- given Vb6 calculated earlier, integrate the twist
		Tbk-->bk+1 = exp(Vb6)
	- express position in the world frame:
		- Tsb,k+1 = Tsb,k * Tbk-->bk+1

Things to fix:
- pass in Tb0 from the geometry file

New:
- Je is the only matrix that looks off
- last 4 columns match the expected output; 5th from last is mostly
	right except for [3,5] 
		--> find out what these columns correspond to
		---> ok these columns correspond to the arm Jacobian; I had
			an error in my Blist
- first 4 columns: where the values are supposed to be the same
	(ex: wheel 1 and 2 vs. wheel 3 and 4), they are;
	however the values don't match up

- solved. next: test the twist generation with Pi gains of 1 for each
	aspect of error.



Done:
- write NextState() outline
- determine Tsb(q) from omnidirectional robot control
- determine Jacobian of arm from Blist; JacobianBody()
	at given joint angles
- Find matrix F that relates Vb = F*delta(theta), or 
	relates motion of the wheels to 
	
- Take F from Mobile Robots section and relate to:
	Vb = F*u
	Vb6 = [0 0 F 0 ] *u
	Ve = [AdTeb(theta)]*Vb6
	Ve = [Ad(  T0e-1(theta) * Tb0^-1)]* F6*u
	Jarm = [Ad(  T0e-1(theta) * Tb0^-1)]* F6
	
- calculate Je(theta) = [Jbase(theta) Jarm(theta)]
