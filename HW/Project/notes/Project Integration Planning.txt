Full project integration

To-Do:
- note: changed Rcond = 1E-2 to 1E-1 in pinv() due to some jitteriness
	/instability during tuning Pi
- ask about whether wheel motions make sense; what could be causing jerking
	of chassis forward
- in addition to Jacobian Pseudoinverse limits:
	- impose limits on joint velocities. they recommend this in the assignment
	- see what reasonable limits are for both joints and wheels individually
		based on velocities in file
- add time arrays to plots using t_span and dt to make x axis more meaningful
- in end: remove u_thetad arrays from simulation code
- joint and wheel angle velocities:
	- not complying with specified velocity limits
	- real wheel speeds can go to up to +/- 10; jerky speeds can be magnitude of 
		5, 10, or 25
	- real joint speeds can go up to +/- 10; jerky speeds can be order of magnitude of 5, 
		10, or 20
	- impose limit of 10 just to make sure limits work; then refine method
		of preventing jerk

			
- Notes:
	- robot starts out doing lots of jerky motions - must be because
		it starts out at a singularity
			- check if changing the tol. on pinv() would help - experiment
				with 1E-2 and 1E-3
			- results: 1E-3 was too jerky; 1E-2 had some issues with not 
				tracking as fast as the other arrays, but it was stable
			- if other places use pinv() use it again there
	- robot wheels seem to slide - check on conversion of joint motions
		to wheel motions
			- sliding seems less "bad" but still some motion orthogonal 
				to rollers
	- log file: shows the progress of your code, that you ran it, and that it
		finished. shows the TAs approx. how long program should take
			- for this course it's not too long; but it's good to have it
				anyway
	- inputs: program doesn't have to have inputs, like described in the 
		file; can just have diff. matrices that you comment and uncomment
		out
	- error twist: can plot angular and linear components of error on one 
		plot or separate plots.
	 - make dt from simulation show up in plots
	 - can try:
		-limiting accel of joints from one timestep to another
			- max reasonable accel appears to be 0.15 for joints & wheels
		- using a different timescaling in TrajGenerator
		- check on Vd - should it be 1/dt
	- Kp only seems to be affecting the joint angles, not the wheels
	- new method: calculate joint state using method in the book
	
questions:
- question about the pseudoinverse limits
	- said if simulation runs well with the test trajectories from
		milestone 1, the pseudoinverse is fine
	- said 1E-1 is very high - punishes too many possible joint angles
		1E-2 is the one I think I'll settle on
- question about reasonable wheel motions
	- free-sliding direction looks weird w/ the rollers on top, but
		rollers on bottom are rotated by 90 deg
- question about the error twist
	- really wants to see all 6 components - can plot on different graphs

		
Re/ what the Prof has said in class:
- solution to impose "joint limits" is to modify the Jacobian
	Pseudoinverse calculation when we reach a joint limit: change the
	Jacobian at that instant to "cancel out" motion about one joint.
	show the model that you cannot increase that joint angle 
	at the current instant to achieve the desired config
- should be able to provide different initial and final
	configs of cube to both CoppeliaSim and our motion planner -
	and it should be able to geenrate a well-executed motion plan
	for different ICs than the one provided
- ReadMe file will contain info on any non-standard approaches we took
	to solving problems; any behavior I observed that wasn't working the
	way we thought it would. Won't get points off if we acknowledge there were 
	errors
- Look in depth at the NewTask aspect, and the full project integration
	steps on the page
- OH on Mon and Tues; don't expect to bring code, show it, and debug it
	--> conceptual questions and informed debugging process are necessary
	
	
	
	

		

		
Done:

- ask about Xerr - should start nonzero right? mine ramps up for a certain reason - 
	proportional to velocity of bot
		- findings: I was telling the robot that the init posn was the same
			as the expected init posn
		- check that T0e with zero joint angles is same as M0e

	- significant error from desired path
		- resolved! with just Kp = 1 it's pretty good at tracking
	- gripper does not open or close

Code outline:
once robot_config13_array and Xerr_array are populated:
- save results to CSV files for each
- plot the error over time:
	- Xerr is a twist; can plot either	
		- all 6 elements of Xerr over time, or
		- magnitude of linear error and angular error (may be more readable)
		
- allow NextState() to take in a 13-vector; do value checking. if len() = 13,
	do something; otherwise if len() != 12, raise exception
	- don't do this b/c it'll make testing NextState() more arduous.
		edit it in post
- edit TrajGenerator to scale times of each trajectory segment to meet a desired
	amount of time
		- related: ensure dt fed to NextState(), dt fed to FBC(), and 
			dt used to generate trajectories agree
- find out why V_new is generating as a 6x6 matrix rather than a twist
- test out trajectory.csv to make sure path makes sense
- make a function to convert from trajectories in Array13 form back
	to SE(3) matrices
		- simple: np.reshape() on the 1st 9 elements, reshape to 3x1 for the
			next 3 els; return gripperState too
		- test with matrices other than I
- Modify FeedbackControl() to:
	- take in Xerr_int. I prefer this over modifying a global variable.
	- return a tuple (Xerr, Xerr_int) along with Vnew, in order to track Xerr_int
		and to plot Xerr
		
		
- Define initial robot posn as 13-vector: robot_config13
- generate reference trajectory from init. EE config to desired
	EE config using TrajGenerator
- N = len(ref_traj)

define Xerr_array = np.zeros(N-1) 
define robot_config13_array = np.zeros((N,13))
set robot_config13_array[0] = robot_config13
set Xerr_array[0]=..? --> won't know this 

- for i in range(N-1):
	- calculate current SE(3) config from robot_config13
		- Tsb: uses chassis phi, x, y
		- Tb0: constant
		- T0e: use forward kinematics
	- set Xd = ref_traj[i]
		- will need to convert from 13-vector to SE(3) mat
	- set Xd_next = ref_traj[i+1]
		- will need to convert from 13-vector to SE(3) mat
	- run FeedbackControl() and get:
		- next EE twist
		- Xerr
		- Xerr_int
	- set robot_config13 = NextState(twist)
	
	- set robot_config13_array[i+1] = robot_config13
	- set Xerr_array[i] = Xerr
