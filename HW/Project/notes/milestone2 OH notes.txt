findings from office hours:
- we should be testing with Scene 8 only
- target of this homework is not to be generating joint angles to get from
	start posn to end posn; it's to be generating SE3 matrices from
	start posn to end posn
- the 13 values in the CSV file are just the 12 elements of an SE(3)
	matrix, plus the gripper state
		- can't believe I got this wrong - I thought the 13 values
			of interest were the 13 joint angles
		- should read the instructions more thoroughly and not assume
- upon doing this the end effector should travel as expected,
	following a path in the world over a set amount of time
