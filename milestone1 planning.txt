Milestone 1

############

Outline:

You will write a simulator for the kinematics of the youBot. The main 
function in the simulator, let's call it NextState, is specified by 
the following inputs and outputs (you may modify these inputs and 
outputs if you wish):

Input:

A 12-vector representing the current configuration
	of the robot (3 variables for the chassis configuration, 
	5 variables for the arm configuration, and 4 variables 
	for the wheel angles).
A 9-vector of controls indicating the wheel speeds u 
	(4 variables) and the arm joint speeds \dot{\theta} (5 variables).
A timestep Δt.
A positive real value indicating the maximum angular 
	speed of the arm joints and the wheels. For example, 
	if this value is 12.3, the angular speed of the wheels 
	and arm joints is limited to the range [-12.3 radians/s,
	 12.3 radians/s]. Any speed in the 9-vector of controls
	 that is outside this range will be set to the nearest 
	 boundary of the range. If you don't want speed limits,
	 just use a very large number. If you prefer, your 
	 function can accept separate speed limits for the 
	 wheels and arm joints.
Output: A 12-vector representing the configuration of the 
	robot time Δt later.

The function NextState is based on a simple first-order
	Euler step, i.e.,

	new arm joint angles = (old arm joint angles) + (joint speeds) * Δt
	new wheel angles = (old wheel angles) + (wheel speeds) * Δt
	new chassis configuration is obtained from odometry, 
		as described in Chapter 13.4

To-Do:


	#big question: do we need the second derivative of position?
	#----> I don't think we do. nothing suggests that we'll need that to
	#calculate the next position, and we don't return the next velocitiess
	
	#question: once we have a T matrix for new posn in the world frame, 
	#how do we go from there to phi, x, y?
	#--> we can derive x, y, from the position vector
	#--> we can derive phi from the rotation matrix: take the log of an R and 
		# we get a screw axis we can follow for a joint angle phi
