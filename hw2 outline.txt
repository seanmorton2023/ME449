Environment: use Jupyter notebook. will be easiest to test in
-> github for version history, of course



needs for code:

- write Newton-Raphson algorithm for matrix operations
	(one iteration of cycle)
	- TBD, will need to review N-R process
	
- write formula to calculate twist error of current position
	from goal position
	- inputs: M, list_of_thetalists (all angles that have been
		calculated so far), Jb or Js, target transf. Tsb
	- calculate current transformation matrix of e.e. Tsa from:
		- starting config M
		- joint angles theta_list
		- Jacobian of robot in S or B frame
	- find Tab: Tab = (Tsa)^-1 Tsb
	- find twist by [V]*t = log(Tab)
		- assume rotating w/ twist for unit time 1sec will
			give trans. matrix
	- V = se3ToVec([V])
			
- write function to calculate magnitude of angular and linear error
	- fairly simple, can test it easily
	- inputs: a twist V
	- outputs: [eomg_curr, elin_curr]
	
- write function to save current joint vectors as a line of a .csv file
	- also fairly simple
	- inputs: theta_list
	- writes a line of CSV file
	- outputs: nothing; stored in the CSV
			
- write function to convert a series of joint angles into positions 
	in xyz coords of the end effector
		- inputs: M, Blist/Slist, csv_filepath
		- opens and iterates through CSV file
		- uses: FKinBody() or FKinSpace(), inputs M, Blist/Slist, thetalist
		- calculate a transformation matrix that results from 
			the joint angles applied
		- take home configuration of robot and pre- or post-multiply
			transformation from joint angles
		- use [R,p] = TransToRp(T) to get the translation of the end
			effector rel. to. body frame; extract set x,y,z = p
		- outputs a list of lists, [ [x,y,z], [x,y,z], ...)

- write function to display x, y, z posns over time
	- inputs: xyz_list, a list of lists of xyz coords
	- take in the CSV file for this so we don't have to write 
		code for it that depends on prev. outputs in the Jupyter notebook
	- look up a python library that can do 3D plots you can rotate
	- find out how to do line plots
	- have target_posn be an input; calculate initial_posn from array
		indexing		
	- outputs: a figure; display it when ready


		
		
	
- apply Newton-Raphson to
